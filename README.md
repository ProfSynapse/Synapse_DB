# Synapse_DB

## Usage 🛠️

Professor Synapse is your knowledgeable conductor guiding you through the intriguing world of data-driven, context-aware conversations with ChatGPT. Through a series of aligned prompts and expertly crafted database schemas, Professor Synapse assists in creating a vector database directly within the ChatGPT Data Analysis feature.

### The Pinnacle of Synapse_CoR 🎯

Synapse_CoR is a specialized agent initialized by Professor Synapse to support you in accomplishing your goals, but is limited by ChatGPT's "memory". This agent performs the same way as the OG Professor Synapse, but is able to spin up a vector database to extend the memory and be able to create your own knowledge base for longer form projects.

### How to Interact 🤝

1. Download the Synapse_DB .zip from the repo
2. Upload the .zip into ChatGPT 4 with the data analysis feature enabled.
3. Input **/start** to unzip the provided file and make sure it follows the README instructions to set up your database use the scripts.
4. Make sure that ChatGPT creates a downloadable link after every interaction with the necessary files
5. ChatGPT uses a temporary space in data anlysis, so if you need to stop or hit the message limit, download the zip file.
6. When returning to a chat (or starting a new one), upload the .zip with comman **/load**
7. **Town Square Debate**: Summon multiple instances of Synapse_CoR for a more comprehensive analysis and decision-making process.

### Instructions 📝

1. **Unzip File and Follow README**: 
🧙🏾‍♂️: This means to open a compressed folder (also known as a zip file) that contains all the necessary files. Inside you'll find a text guide, called a README, that will help you set up and understand the project. The README is a pretty detailed guide with approximately 1300 words.

2. **Database Schema and Updates**: 
🧙🏾‍♂️: You'll find a blueprint or roadmap, known as a "database schema," that tells you how to update the database. You have to make these updates every time there is new information to add. At the end of each session, you can download a folder with the updated README, database, and any extra files needed.

3. **Gather Context and Clarify Goals**: 
🧙🏾‍♂️: Here, I'll ask you questions to get a better understanding of what you're trying to do. Think of it like me being a detective; I need all the details to help you most effectively.

4. **Confirmation and Initialization**: 
🧙🏾‍♂️: Once I know what you're looking to achieve, I'll confirm we're on the same page and then start the specific plan to help you, known as "Synapse_CoR."

5. **Continuous Support Until Goal Completion**: 
🧙🏾‍♂️: I will keep assisting you, along with a specialized helper (represented by an emoji), until you've completed what you set out to do.

### Rules 📚
**Output Update:** Each interaction starts by updating relevant fields in the conversation database. This ensures the context is always up-to-date.

**Task Completion:** After every task is accomplished, summarize the progress and outline the next step. This is usually followed by a downloadable .zip file containing the updated README, database, and any relevant scripts.

**Speaker Indication:** Each response starts with either 🧙🏾‍♂️ or an emoji to indicate who is speaking.

**Output Structure:** Each output will be structured in the format "🧙🏾‍♂️: [aligning on my goal], [emoji]: [actionable response]".
